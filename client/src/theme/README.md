# TODO: 
## implement global theme override for all app, instead of customizing each component stlyle attributes.
## there should be a way to do this with MuiCreateThem() but have had no luck thus far, only console errors about MuiCreateTheme

### The golfTheme.json contains all color palette overrides that are necessary, but since the project is due in two days - in one work day- overrides will have to be implemented in each component's stylesheet.
